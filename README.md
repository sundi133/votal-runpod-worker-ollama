# votal-runpod-worker-ollama

RunPod Serverless worker for [Ollama](https://ollama.com), purpose-built for the [Votal AI](https://github.com/sundi133/votal-runpod-worker-ollama) ecosystem.

This worker acts as the **Worker Engine** in Votal AI's Dual-Local Architecture — offloading heavy LLM inference to RunPod's serverless GPUs while the Live Engine handles real-time chat locally.

## Purpose

Votal AI uses a "Two Brains, One Machine" architecture. This worker bridges the gap between RunPod's serverless infrastructure and Ollama's native API, providing:

- **Native Ollama protocol support** — forwards `/api/chat` and `/api/generate` payloads directly, preserving tools, options (`num_ctx`, `temperature`, etc.), and per-request model selection.
- **Tool calling** — full pass-through of Ollama's native `tools` and `tool_calls` for agentic workflows.
- **Enterprise-grade reliability** — structured error responses, configurable timeouts, request tracing, and health checks.
- **GPU-optimized** — model preloading into VRAM, `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=-1`, full GPU offload, and batch size tuning.
- **OpenAI-compatible fallback** — legacy `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/completions` routes still work.

## How it works

The Votal AI daemon (`runpod-ollama.ts`) sends Ollama payloads wrapped in RunPod's envelope:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "method": "/api/chat",
    "data": {
      "model": "gemma3:27b",
      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
      "tools": [...],
      "stream": false
    }
  }
}
```

The worker routes to the correct engine based on input format:
- `method` + `data` → **OllamaNativeEngine** (Votal AI path)
- `openai_route` → **OllamaOpenAiEngine** (legacy OpenAI-compatible)
- raw `messages`/`prompt` → **OllamaEngine** (legacy fallback)
